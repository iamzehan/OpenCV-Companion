                ## Drawing Geometric Shapes with OpenCV üìêüìè üü•üî¥üî∫
                
                ## Goal
                Learn to draw different geometric shapes with OpenCV. The functions covered include 
                `cv.line()`, `cv.circle()`, `cv.rectangle()`, `cv.ellipse()`, `cv.putText()`, and more.

                ## Code
                In all the above functions, you will find common arguments as given below:

                - `img`: The image where you want to draw the shapes.
                - `color`: Color of the shape. For BGR, pass it as a tuple, e.g., (255, 0, 0) for blue. 
                For grayscale, just pass the scalar value.
                - `thickness`: Thickness of the line or circle, etc. 
                If -1 is passed for closed figures like circles, it will fill the shape. The default thickness is 1.
                - `lineType`: Type of line, whether 8-connected, anti-aliased line, etc. By default, it is 8-connected. 
                `cv.LINE_AA` gives an anti-aliased line, which looks great for curves.
